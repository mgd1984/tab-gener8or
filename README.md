# Tab Gener8or: Turn Your Riffs into Tabs 🎸➡️📄

Ever wish you could quickly jot down that cool riff you just played? Or figure out a tricky guitar part from an MP3? **Tab Gener8or** is here to help.

This tool uses some cool AI magic to "listen" to your MP3 guitar recordings and automatically generate guitar tablature (tabs) and MIDI files. It's perfect for:

-   **Documenting Your Ideas:** Quickly capture riffs and song ideas before they disappear.
-   **Learning Songs:** Get a head start on figuring out parts by ear.
-   **Sharing Music:** Easily share your guitar parts with others in a readable format.
-   **Experimenting:** See how AI interprets musical audio.

## How Does the Magic Happen? ✨

Under the hood, Tab Gener8or combines two powerful open-source tools:

1.  **[Basic Pitch](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch)** (by Spotify): This AI model analyzes the audio (your MP3) and detects the musical notes being played, along with their timing. It converts this information into a standard MIDI file. Think of it as the AI "ear."
2.  **[Tayuya](https://github.com/jcbhmr/tayuya)**: This clever tool takes the MIDI file generated by Basic Pitch and translates the notes into guitar-specific tablature, figuring out likely string and fret positions. It's the AI "fingers" working out how to play the notes on a guitar.

## Getting Started: Let's Make Some Tabs

Ready to try it out? Here's how to get Tab Gener8or running on your own computer:

1.  **Grab the Code:**
    Clone this repository to your machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mgd1984/tab-gener8or.git
    cd tab-gener8or
    ```

2.  **Create a Safe Space (Virtual Environment):**
    It's best practice to keep project dependencies separate. Let's create a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv # You might need to use python3 depending on your system
    ```
    Now, activate it:
    *   macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
    *   Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    *(You should see `(venv)` appear at the start of your terminal prompt)*

3.  **Install the Brains (Dependencies):**
    With your virtual environment active, install all the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(This might take a few minutes, especially the first time, as it downloads libraries like TensorFlow for Basic Pitch).*

4.  **Run the App:**
    Make sure your virtual environment is still active (`(venv)` is visible) and start the Streamlit web app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your web browser should automatically open to the app's interface (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

5.  **Generate Tabs:**
    -   Upload an MP3 file containing a guitar recording.
    -   Click "Convert to Guitar Tab".
    -   Wait for the AI to work its magic.
    -   View the generated tab right in the app and download the tab text file or the MIDI file.

## Tips for Tinkerers & Best Results 🛠️

-   **Clean Audio is Key:** The clearer your recording (minimal noise, effects, or other instruments), the better the AI can "hear" the notes accurately. Direct input (DI) recordings often work great.
-   **Single Instrument Focus:** While it might sometimes work with multiple instruments, Basic Pitch is primarily designed for single-instrument (monophonic or polyphonic) analysis. Feed it just the guitar track for best results.
-   **Clear Note Definition:** Heavily distorted or complex, fast passages can be challenging for the AI. Start with cleaner tones and well-defined riffs if you're having trouble.
-   **Command Line Power:** Prefer the command line? Use `main.py` for direct processing:
    ```bash
    # Make sure your venv is active first
    python main.py path/to/your/audio.mp3
    ```
    This will output MIDI and Tab files directly in the same directory.
-   **Explore the Code:**
    -   `app.py`: Contains the main Streamlit UI, audio processing logic (`process_audio`), and tab formatting (`format_tab_for_display`). Feel free to tweak the formatting.
    -   `main.py`: The command-line interface script.
    -   `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python libraries used.

## Deployment Options ☁️

-   **Streamlit Cloud:** The easiest way to share your app online. Push your code to GitHub, connect your repo in Streamlit Cloud, and deploy. (Just be mindful of the potential Python version issues discussed in the commit history if using `basic-pitch==0.4.0`).
-   **Docker:** A `Dockerfile` is included if you prefer containerizing the app for deployment elsewhere.
